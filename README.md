dotfiles
========

My vim configure has been pulled from all over.  There is almost nothing that I didn't steal.
Feel free to steal anything you find useful.

Installation
============

git clone git://github.com/r00k/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install

Vim plugins are managed through vundle. You'll need to install vundle to get them.

git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
Run :BundleInstall in vim.
